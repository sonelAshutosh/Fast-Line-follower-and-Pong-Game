# flf_using_pid
Code with the applied PID algorithm for fast line follower robot, tested on Raspberry Pi Pico.
my robot here using 8 ir sensor array for detection of path, two motors and a castor wheel.
A voltage booster, a motor driver acting as a driving force in the project, and connected as usual.
additional not so essential components include oled screen, bluetooth sensor, and switches programmed to perform the comforting functions.
